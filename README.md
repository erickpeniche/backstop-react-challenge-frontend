# [REACT FRONT END] Backstop React Engineer Code Challenge

This repo contains the code for the fronted webapp written in Javascript. It consists of a webapp that uses React v16.X and Redux to fetch Digimons from the back end app. This React app runs on `http://localhost:3001`

## IMPORTANT NOTE:
The backend app needs to be running in `http://localhost:3000` in order for the front end to be able to fetch data.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open your browser and point to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) while also running the backend app as instructed previously.
